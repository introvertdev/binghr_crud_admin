# BingHR Laravel Admin CRUD Dashboard [![linkedin](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-0A66C2?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://ng.linkedin.com/in/oyetade-tobi)

Using Laravel PHP framework, I have developed an API and frontend for user administration using HTML, Jquery, AJAX, CSS, PHP and Jquery DataTables.

#### Added Features
The following are added features in the application:
#####
● Datatable Buttons
##### This can be used to **``Export to PDF,CSV and EXCEL``**, and can also be used to **``COPY``** table data and as well **``Print``** table records
#### ● Dark Mode
##### For easy readability, I implemented a dark/light mode swithc on the top left corner of the dashboard

#### ● Permissions Module.
##### The permissions is dynamically created which is binded to each data record and is stored in the database and can be updated individually

#### ● Employee ID Generator.
##### For data integrity and employee ID uniqueness sake, I created and ID generator that helps associate a unique random 8-digit ID to each employee
